(PE investor would use US$15.1m to get the rights to use Courts brands, according to Business Times)",,,"COURTS MAMMOTH GROUP   
  The Courts Mammoth Group comprises Courts Mammoth Berhad (Courts Mammoth), PT Courts Indonesia Tbk (PTCI) and Courts Asia Investments (Labuan) Ltd (Courts Labuan). The core business of the Group is retailing consumer electronics from popular brands such as Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Philips, Panasonic, JVC, LG, Toshiba, Canon, Creative Apple, Microsoft and Acer as well as furniture.   
 Courts Mammoth is the largest consumer electronics and furniture retailer in Malaysia with a network of over 70 stores nationwide and a staff strength of over 1,900. Incorporated on 23 July 1986 as a private limited company under the name Courts Furnishers (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd, the Company changed its name to Courts Mammoth Sdn Bhd on 30 June 1997. It subsequently converted into a public company and assumed its present name, Courts Mammoth Berhad on 1 July 1997. Courts Mammoth was listed on the Main Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (now known as Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad) on October 11, 2000.   
  
  A 94.99%-owned subsidiary of Courts Mammoth, PTCI was established on 21 June 1994 under the name PT Matahari Tatagriya Pesona. The name was later changed to PT Matahari Courts Tbk and was listed on the Surabaya Stock Exchange in July 2002. On 24 November 2003, the company was acquired by Courts Mammoth and re-named PT Courts Indonesia Tbk. As at 30 June 2006, PTCI has over 40 stores in Bali, Lombok and Java. 
Courts Labuan was set up in May 2004 and to-date remains dormant.   
    
  COURTS MAMMOTH BERHAD   
  Courts Mammoth started with one store in Johor Bahru 20 years ago. The Company also leases 14 stock holding areas with a total floor area in excess of 423,423 sq ft to store and distribute its consumer electronics and furniture to ensure prompt delivery to customers.   
    
  Courts Mammoth has over 70 stores in Malaysia and is represented in every state including Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia. Courts Mammoth offers the widest possible range of over 2,000 consumer electronics and furniture items. The Courts Mammoth philosophy of supplying essential household items to the masses on affordable terms has enabled the Company to cater to the different needs and tastes of the majority of the population.   
      
  COURTS METROPOLITAN   
  In December 2005, Courts Mammoth launched its first sub-brand, ‘Courts Metropolitan’, which are stores sited within high-traffic shopping malls and supermarket concessions.   
      
  Courts Metropolitan store features the latest choices in desktop and notebook computers, MP3 players, video cameras, digital cameras, mobile phones, LCD and plasma televisions and home-theatre systems from leading brand names. In furniture, the emphasis is on the highly successful Studio 2020 contemporary range and transitional pieces, all presented in collection format i.e., sofa sets with matching coffee table and rug etc.   
      
  To further distinguish itself from the core brand, products at Courts Metropolitan are showcased in a more contemporary setting with the store design, signage and façade created to make an impact and to stand out within an enclosed mall location amongst the other tenants.   
      
  The first Courts Metropolitan store opened in Giant Plentong, Johor whilst the second store was opened in Ampang Point, Kuala Lumpur.
   
      
  PT COURTS INDONESIA TBK   
  The Company was established in Indonesia on 21 June 1994 under the name PT Matahari Tatagriya Pesona. The name changed to PT Matahari Courts Tbk on its listing on the Surabaya Stock Exchange in July 2002.  On 24 November 2003 following its acquisition by Courts Mammoth Berhad, the Company was re-named PT Courts Indonesia Tbk.

25 Nov 2013: Baring announced having joined chariman Mr Shi Yuzhu to submit a go private proposal to acquire all outstanding shares at US$11.75 per share, valuing the company at US$2.8 billion. On the same date as the go private offer is made, Baring has reached an agreement with Mr Shi to purchase 11.8 million shares at US$9.79 per share from Mr Shi, representing an amount of US$115.5 million. However, the transaction also comes with an agreement that if the privatisation goes forward, Baring is required to pay the difference between the pruchase price of US$9.79 to and privatisation offer price of US$11.75(US$12 at last). Thus this can be viewed as one transaction, such as Baring buys part of the stake from public shareholders, part of the stake from Mr Shi.
